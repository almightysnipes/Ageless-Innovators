Today's generation is all about video games. As advanced as technology is today, video games are no longer
just being played on the console. Video games are can be played through streaming services, tablets, 
smartphones, and desktops. In order for games to come to life, programming language is written for every
interaction the game might have from the start menu to the cinematic end credits. Now, what does this have 
to do with the Ageless Innovators?

We decided to come together to build a system for young students in middle and high school where they 
can use different programming languages to build play their own video game. For example, if you're 
playing a game similar to Super Mario Brothers, you would want to your character to move, so if you want 
your character to jump over an object or simply jump, type 'jump' in the command space. If you're up 
against a boss, you can type 'stike' in the command space to attack your opponent.
